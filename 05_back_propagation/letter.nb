Dear Nicholas, 

\tI returned to Cavan on the bus yesterday and found myself full of doubt.

One thing I was not doubtful about was my fervent desire to do fundamental \
research in machine learning algorithms .

\tI had hoped that pursuing the speckle investigation would - as a spinoff - \
train me further in this field that I care so much about. (but) I realized \
that applying a neural network to a data set is not the same as understanding \
what was happening in the neural net (convolutional or otherwise). I was \
disappointed that after an entire summer of working - almost non-stop - I \
could not achieve our goals. I still think it is feasible, its just simply \
that I do not know enough about algorithm design and theory. I need to spend \
a number of years learning about this.
\t
\tI signed up and organized my fees for your structured masters in good \
faith. I thought it would be good to publish a paper on the speckle issue, \
but now looking at the modules on offer, I can see that few of them are \
linked with what I am passionate about.
\t
\tI have had a long chat with my Dad who knows me quite well. He agrees that \
I should pursue my goals. Thus I am going to do the applied maths diploma at \
NUIG in order to learn more about linear algebra, statistics and neural \
network theory. 
\t
\tI am sorry to let you down like this, but I think the paradigms of academic \
life are changing. I care more about acquiring basic knowledge about my \
chosen field than getting a PhD or MSc. I don\[CloseCurlyQuote]t want to make \
an idiot of myself publishing papers before I understand the field in depth.
\t
\tMy heartfelt thanks for your support through my 2 internships with you. I \
understand my situation regarding with regards to academia and neural \
networks much better due to my interaction with you. I will be forever \
grateful for your insights.
\t
Best regards,
Conor
